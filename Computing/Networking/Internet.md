- The **Internet** is the technical infrastructure that makes the Web possible
- At its most basic, the Internet is a large network of computers which communicate all together
### Simple Network
- When two computers need to communicate, you have to link them, either physically (usually with an Ethernet cable) or wirelessly (for example with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth systems)
- If you were trying to connect more than two computers this would quickly get complicated
	- Connecting 10 computers would require 45 wires and 9 ports per computer
