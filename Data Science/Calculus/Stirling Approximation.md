# Stirling's Formula

- The number of #permutation of $n$ distinct objects is given by $n!$
- How quickly does $n!$ grow as a function of $n$?
	- This behaviour is approximated by Sitrling's approximation

**Theorem**
The factorial function $n!$ is approximated by;

$$n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} [\ \frac{n}{e} ]\ ^n$$

Further, for any positive integer $n$, we have the bounds:

$$\sqrt{2 \pi} n^{n + \frac{1}{2}}e^{-n} \leq n! \leq e n ^{n + \frac{1}{2}} e^{-n}$$
