* A probability density function (PDF) is a function that defines the relationship between a random variable and its probability
	* You can find the probability of a given random variable using the function
* There are two different types of random variables
	* Discrete variables
		* A variable that can only take on a certain finite value within a specific range
			* It usually separates the values by a finite interval
			* The values are also definite
	* Continuous variable
		* A continuous random variable can take on infinite different values within a range of values
			* Rain observed in a day could be 1.7cm but the exact value is not known
				* It could be 1.701, 1.7687, etc.
			* You can only define the range of values a continuous variable may fall into
				* Within this range, the variable can take on an infinite number of values
* Consider a random variable $x$ with PDF $f(x)$ that defines the range of probabilities

* The above PDF is a bell-shaped curve 
* To find the probability of a variable falling betwen points $a$ and $b$ you need to find the area under the curve
