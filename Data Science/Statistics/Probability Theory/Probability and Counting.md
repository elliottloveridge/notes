## Probability
**Probability** is the measurement of what chance some specified outcome has for happening (typically expressed as a percentage or fraction)

The set of all possible outcomes is called the **sample space**. The sum of the probabilities of all outcomes in a sample space is exactly 1, or 100%.

**Example: Two Dice**

If you have an eight sided die and a six sided die, is the probability of rolling a larger number on the eight sided die compared to the six sided die greater than 50%?

- ==For a simple problem such as this you should draw a grid of all possibilities to help understand - this is known as an **outcome distribution chart**.==

### Counting
Probability in a basic form is just **counting**.

You can think of the fractions from probability as expressing a pair of counting problems:
- how many ways can we get what we want **vs.** 
- how many outcomes there are total.

$$\frac{\text{outcomes that fit our prediction}}{\text{total number of outcomes overall}}$$

So if you were asked;

```
What is the probability of rolling two die and them summing to 7?
```

You would look at the number of outcomes where they sum to 7  over the number of (non-unique, total) possible outcomes.

==The answer is therefore $\frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6}$==
