## Probability Rules

The **union** of two sets contains all elements contained in either set (or both sets)
- $x \in A \cup B$ if $x \in A$ or $x \in B$ (or both)

The **intersection** of two sets contains only the elements that are in both sets
-  $x \in A \cap B$ if $x \in A$ and $x \in B$

The **complement** of a set $A$ contains everything that is *not* in set $A$
- Notated as $A'$ or $A^c$
