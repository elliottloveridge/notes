## Independence

[[Conditional Probability]] showed that they are able to quantify the extent to which knowledge of the occurrence of an event affects the probability of another

In some cases however, it **does not**. These events are said to be independent.

Formally, events $A$ and $B$ are independent if;

$$P(A|B) = P(A)$$

This does not cover the case of $P(B) = 0$, but the following is equivalent and does;

$$P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$$
