# Regression

- A technique used for the modeling and analysis of numerical data
- Exploits the relationship between two or more variables so that we can gain information about one of them through knowing values of the other
- Regression can be used for prediction, estimation, hypothesis testing, and modeling causal relationships

## Simple Form
Regression, in a simple version, takes the form;
$$Y = X_1 + X_2 + X_3$$

Where:
- $Y$ is known as the **dependent variable**
	- Also called outcome variable, response variable, or target variable
- $X$ is known as the **independent variable**
	- Also called predictor variable or explanatory variable
