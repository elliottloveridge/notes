# Machine Learning Engineering for Production (ML Ops)
## Course 1 - Introduction to Machine Learning in Production
- Week 1 - Deployment
- Week 2 - Modeling
- Week 3 - Data
	- Optional: Scoping
### Week 1 - Overview of the ML Lifecycle and Deployment
> See [[ML Lifecycle]] and [[Deployment]]
#### Learning Objectives
- Identify the key components of the [[ML Lifecycle]]
	- Scoping
	- Data
	- Modeling
	- [[Deployment]]
- Define “concept drift” as it relates to ML projects
	- *Concept drift is a change in the desired mapping from $x \rightarrow y$
	- *Data drift is a change in your data distribution $x$
- Differentiate between shadow, canary, and blue-green [[Deployment Patterns]] in the context of varying degrees of automation
- Compare and contrast the ML modeling iterative cycle with the cycle for deployment of ML products
- List the typical metrics you might track to monitor concept drift
