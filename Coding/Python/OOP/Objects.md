# Objects

## What is an Object?
- Objects are an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
- Conceptually, when you define a [[Coding/Python/Classes/Classes|class]] you are defining your own type
	- 12 is an instance of an `int` object, for example
		- Each instance is also an object

### Python Objects
- Python is an Object Oriented Programming (OOP) Language
	- Everything in Python is an object
		- `a.__add__(b)` is the same as `a + b`
	- Even data types are implemented as Classes
