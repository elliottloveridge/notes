# Searching Algorithms

Searching algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

These algorithms are generally classified into two categories:
1. **Sequential Search**: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked. For example [[Linear Search|linear search]].
2. **Interval Search**: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures. This type of searching algorithm is much more efficient as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half. For example [[Binary Search|binary search]].
