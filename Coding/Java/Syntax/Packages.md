- In Java, a group of **[[Coding/Java/Syntax/Classes]]** are held in one place
	- Similar to how you might put all of your files for one course or project in the same folder on your computer
- Java, as a platform, comes with a huge library of packages
	- We call this large main library of packages an Application Programming Interface, or API
