# OOP

## What is OOP?
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP) aims to combine the data and the processes that act on it into objects
	- This is known as [[Encapsulation|encapsulation]]
- OOP uses [[Engineering/Python/Classes/Classes|classes]] and [[Engineering/Python/Methods/Methods|methods]] to combine data and functions that act on that data
	- Just using objects and classes to store data is not OOP
		- It also includes encapsulation, composition, inheritance and [[Delegation|delegation]]
