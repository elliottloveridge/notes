**Dynamic programming** refers to a problem-solving approach in which you pre-compute and store simpler, similar sub-problems, in order to build up the solution to a complex problem.

It is similar to [[Recursion|recursion]], in which calculating the base case allow us to inductively determine the final value. This bottom-up approach works well when the new value depends only on previously calculated values.

This is different from #divide-and-conquer type problems where storage of simpler problems is **not** necessary.

Some common examples that highlight the uses of dynamic programming are:
1. [[Fibonacci Numbers]]
2. [[Grid Walker]]
