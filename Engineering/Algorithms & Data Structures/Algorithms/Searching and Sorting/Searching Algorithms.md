# Searching Algorithms

- Searching algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored
- These algorithms are generally classified into two categories:
	1. **Sequential Search**: In this, the list or array is traversed sequentially and every element is checked
		- [[Linear Search|Linear search]]
	2. **Interval Search**: These algorithms are specifically designed for searching in sorted data-structures
		- This type of searching algorithm is much more efficient as they repeatedly target the center of the search structure and divide the search space in half
		- [[Binary Search|Binary search]]
