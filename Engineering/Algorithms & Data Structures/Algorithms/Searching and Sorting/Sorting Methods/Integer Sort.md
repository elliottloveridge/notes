## Integer Sorts

Integer sorts determine for each element $x$ how many elements are less than $x$. This information is used to place each element into the correct slots immediately - no need to rearrange lists.
- Sometimes called counting sorts (though there is a specific counting sort algorithm within integer sorts)
